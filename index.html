            <p style = "text-align: center; font-size: 20pt;"><b>PART I: Collective Memory</b></p>
            <p class = "paragraph"><i>The partition of India in 1947 marked the triumphant moment when the subcontinent gained its independence from British rule. Led by the visionary leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and other freedom fighters, India emerged as a sovereign nation, breaking free from the shackles of colonialism. The partition symbolized the birth of a new, self-governing India.</i></p>
            <p class = "paragraph">This is the Partition story recounted by mainstream narratives. This depiction is shaped by selective recollections, emphasizing peaceful resistance movements and geopolitical change, while disregarding the violence and the refugee crisis that occurred during the Partition. These histories fail to explain how the haphazard transition of power in 1947, with the British retreating from India in less than six months, did not allow for a smooth transition, and instead, led to a breakdown of society.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">During the British retreat, borders were drawn swiftly, often using religious demographics as the sole criteria. The lack of understanding of the underlying tensions and complexities of the diverse South Asian societies fueled chaos. The sudden shift from an imperial colony to independent nations—India and Pakistan—was marked by mass violence, looting, and the targeting of vulnerable minority groups.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">It is only in recent years, with initiatives like the 1947 Partition Archive, that the untold stories of survivors have come to light, challenging dominant narratives and providing a more comprehensive understanding of this painful chapter of history.</p>

            <p style = "text-align: center; font-size: 20pt;"><b>PART II: Pramila Arora</b></p>
            <p class = "paragraph">Born in 1934 in Mogok, Burma, Arora’s early life was a stark contrast to the bustling, technological world of today. The small town where she grew up was nestled in the hills, surrounded by pristine landscapes and untouched by the pollution that plagues modern cities.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">However, the tranquility of Pramila's early years was shattered by the hardships of British rule. Even as a child, she sensed the inequality that permeated society. Her father's encounter with a discriminatory Englishman left a lasting impression on her as a child.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">"Once my father had bought a ticket in second class on the railway. There were no passengers in that room, in that compartment. And suddenly, at one station, an Englishman came, and he threw my father's luggage out of the compartment and asked him to go. And I realized, that is how they treat the people of India. They didn't think that Indians are their equal."</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">In 1947, India gained independence from British rule. However, Pramila and her family didn't celebrate. The occassion was marred by gruesome events like violent riots, railway massacres, and arson. Pramila Arora recounts how trains became sites of horrific violence, with passengers being attacked based on their religious identity. Trains crossing the India Pakistan border carrying refugees would arrive at their destination, their carriages stained with blood. Many times, these trains would arrive with no one left on board— vessels carrying dead bodies into the train station. Families were torn apart, lives were lost, and close-knit communities were shattered apart.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">As communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims grew, Pramila Arora and her family were forced to flee their home. Her father, ensuring the safety of his three daughters, arranged for a truck to transport them. The journey was filled with discomfort – the steel trunks, the terpene-covered luggage, and the truck's painful corners cutting into their bodies. Arora recalled how the stove was left on in their haste to flee home.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">The atmosphere was tense as they traveled through the desolate landscape. Burned houses, abandoned towns, and fields devoid of life bore witness to the tragic events that unfolded during the Partition. Pramila described the eerie silence, the absence of any signs of life, and the overwhelming sense of loss that accompanied them.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">An hour away from the Indian border, the truck's engine sputtered to a stop, out of gas. </p>
            <p class = "paragraph">"When we were near the border, the petrol was no more in our truck. All the trucks went ahead of us and we were left there in the jungle. There was no one who knew that this truck was not moving and it had no petrol.”</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">With no gas and all the other trucks gone, they were alone, stranded in the jungle. Isolated and helpless, time stretched into an agonizing wait. Finally, military vehicles arrived. Soldiers secured a strong rope connecting their stranded truck to the military convoy. The convoy moved forward, carrying the family away from the jungle, to safety across the Indian border and into Khalsa College refugee camp.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">Crossing the border brought a mix of emotions – relief, joy, and a sense of safety. Yet, pain surfaced as Pramila learned of the fate of her grandfather's brother's family. A truck sent for them had carried 40 to 50 people, none of whom survived the journey.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">Upon reaching India, the challenges continued for Pramila and her family. A young teenager at the time, she, along with her sisters, faced the task of rebuilding their lives. She and her family received refugee status. They were given a house in Orissa and her father secured a job there. With no local high schools, my grandmother used what little money she had to buy her own textbooks, studying and testing all on her own to achieve a high school degree. She continued to pursue higher education independently and eventually obtained a teaching degree. When she was 15, she founded a school and taught girls like herself so that they could have the academic opportunities she was never offered.</p>

            <p style = "text-align: center; font-size: 20pt;"><b>PART III: The Partition: Beyond Geopolitics, a Human Tragedy</b></p>
            <p class = "paragraph">The partition wasn't a triumph, or a joyous transition into independence. It was a seismic shift that reverberated through the lives of countless individuals, breaking apart communities, decimating families, and leaving scars so deep that the region is still healing today.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">Personal narratives offer insight into the human dimension of the Partition. The violence and bloodshed that unfolded during the Partition weren't confined to the pages of history but played out in real-time on trains, highways, and border cities. Arora experienced the painful reality of communities breaking apart, family being lost, leaving home, and rebuilding a new life in a foreign place.</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">In the aftermath of the Partition, scars lingered not only on geopolitical maps but within the hearts and memories of those who endured its journey. People's entire lives were uprooted. It’s imperative to recognize the resilience of those who endured, rebuilt, and, against all odds, found strength to forge ahead in the face of adversity during the Partition. The Partition, beyond its geopolitical dimensions, stands as a poignant reminder of the importance of representing the human cost in the pages of history.</p>
